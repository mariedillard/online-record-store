<h1> About Us </h1>
<p>A punk record store located in a dimly lit alley in Seattle, WA. We don't just sell punk. Our small store contains cd's, vinyl, and cassetes of any genre your cold little heart could crave.</p>
<p>Named after the noble russian sighthound, you might see a few of our borzois wandering the aisles. Feel free to give them a pat on the head if they let you. The owner owns five.</p>
